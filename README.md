## Description

I have been tasked to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. I’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. My app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

Start with cloning this repository link on to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/riz1ash786/tech-blog
$ cd tech-blog
```

To install the required dependencies and set up the application, run:

```
$ npm i
```

You will also need to place a .env file in the root directory of the project, in order to connect to your MySQL database. Here's a specific example:

file: .env

```
DB_USER=root
DB_PW=
DB_NAME=my_tech_blog_db
```

## Usage

Enter `node server.js` in terminal to start the application. Once a port has been presented in terminal then type `localhost:3001` into browser to display the application locally. Alternatively, if you wish to deploy this application on Heroku then please click here on the [Heroku Link](https://tech-blog-rizwan.herokuapp.com/ "Heroku Link")

<!-- - To connect to the database run` mysql -u root -p`
- Then source the `schema.sql`
- To seed the file run `npm run seed`
- Finally, to connect to the server run `npm start` -->
